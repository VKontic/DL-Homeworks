		<h1>ABOUT US</h1>
		<img src="resources/about/about1.jpg" alt="bazar">
		<p>
			Global Watch Shop sell luxury men’s and ladies’ watches from some of the World’s most prestigious brands. By acquiring a large proportion of our stock technically pre-owned - but often unworn - we are able to offer highly competitive prices for some of the rarest and most exclusive watches in existence. <br><br>
			With a combined total of more than 30 years’ experience in buying and selling high-end luxury watches, our leadership team of Mike Sheridan, Simon Sullivan and Matt Culling are experts in the field of watchmaking. From our City of London base, we have access to many of the largest watch specialists and suppliers in the UK, and are becoming a market leader when it comes to the supply and sale of prestigious and sought after watches. In fact, for the first time in 2016, we were recognised in the WatchPro Hot 100 list for our excellent customer service, rapid growth and commitment to building a strong, trusted brand.

		<h1>OUR QUALITY PROMISE</h1>
		<p>
			All of the watches we sell are checked for authenticity, quality and ownership. We aim to bring you excellent quality images and detailed information about all of our products, as well as including watches’ original paperwork where possible. All of our pre-owned items are polished and, if needed, serviced before they reach the customer, meaning that they always arrive in the best possible condition. When buying from our site, you can have full peace of mind that – should you change your mind - you can return the item to us within seven days for a refund. <br><br>

			As a part of our service offering to our customers, if you’re looking for a watch from one of our selected brands which is not displayed on our site, feel free to get in touch as we can source a number of watches which we do not show in stock.
