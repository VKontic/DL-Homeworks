	<pre><i>
		Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
		Don't let 'em pick guitars and drive them old trucks
		Make 'em be doctors and lawyers and such

		Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
		'Cause they'll never stay home and they're always alone
		Even with someone they love

		A cowboy ain't easy to love and he's harder to hold
		He'd rather give you a song than silver or gold
		Budwiser buckles and soft faded Wrangler's
		And each night begins a new day
		If you can't understand him and he don't die young
		He'll probably just ride away

		Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
		Don't let 'em pick guitars and drive them old trucks
		Make 'em be doctors and lawyers and such

		Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
		'Cause they'll never stay home andâ€¦</i>

	<h1 id="song2">Johnny Cash - Ghost Riders in the Sky</h1>
	<pre><i>
		An old cowboy went riding out one dark and windy day
		Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
		When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
		Plowing through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw

		Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
		Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
		A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
		For he saw the riders coming hard and he heard their mournful cries

		Yippie I oh oh oh
		Yippie I aye ye ye
		Ghost riders in the sky

		Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
		He's riding hard to catch that herd but he ain't caught em yet
		Cause they got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
		On horses snorting fire as they ride on hear their cries

		As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name
		'If you wanna save your soul from hell a-riding on our range
		Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
		Trying to catch the devil's herd across these endless skies

		Yippie I oh oh oh
		Yippie I aye ye ye
		Ghost riders in the sky
		Ghost riders in the sky
		Ghost riders in the sky

	<h1 id="song3">Johny Cash - I walk the line</h1>
	<pre><i>
		I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
		I keep my eyes wide open all the time
		I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
		Because you're mine, I walk the line

		I find it very, very easy to be true
		I find myself alone when each day is through
		Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
		Because you're mine, I walk the line

		As sure as night is dark and day is light
		I keep you on my mind both day and night
		And happiness I've known proves that it's right
		Because you're mine, I walk the line

		You've got a way to keep me on your side
		You give me cause for love that I can't hide
		For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
		Because you're mine, I walk the line

		I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
		I keep my eyes wide open all the time
		I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
		Because you're mine, I walk the line

	<pre><i>
		Bakiceva ulica
		Vec je zaspala
		Senke se pritajile
		Svetlost zgusnula

		Nasa tiha soba se
		Tek probudila
		Nasa tiha soba je
		Zatreperila

		Ja sam jos studirao
		Ona je radila
		Nocu sam joj citao
		A. Fadejeva

		Nekad bi se cudila
		Mojim pesmama
		Nije mi dopustala
		Da se zamaram

		Nama nova godina
		Nista nije donela
		Kao da se zbunila
		Il se rugala

		Nama nova godina
		Nista nije donela
		Po nebu smo trazili
		Svetlost Vostoka

		Imala je snaznije
		Ruke nego ja
		Imala je snaznije
		Ruke nego ja

		Nije mi dozvolila
		Da je savladam
		Nije mi dopustila
		Da je savladam

	<h1 id="song5">Korni grupa - etida </h1>
	<pre><i>
		Plove u tisini neke davne misli
		vracaju me danima dok sam bio dete
		i divio se beskrajno cudesnim zvucima
		njene mlade duse

		Devojka je svirala najlepsu etidu
		danima u tamnoj sobi za klavirom
		u zanosu te muzike prolece prodje
		zuta jesen dodje

		Bila su dobra vremena dok sam tajno voleo
		i zamisljao je kako poljem sama ide
		lice joj bledo a tanak joj struk
		u travi je na mom dlanu zaspala

		Bila su dobra vremena dok sam tajno voleo
		dok sam svaku rec iz njenih usta zedno pio
		noci u radu a dani u snu
		u sobi s' klavirom sedim sam bez nje
